   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyDREAM's documentation!
===================================
**Quickstart:** The main function to run DREAM is in :py:func:`pydream.core.run_dream`.

This provides reasonable defaults, but a variety of options are available for customizing DREAM.
These can be passed as keyword arguments to :py:func:`pydream.core.run_dream`.  See the :py:class:`pydream.Dream.Dream` class for a list of options.

Examples are available in the `examples <http://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyDREAM/tree/master/pydream/examples>`_ directory of the GitHub repo.
